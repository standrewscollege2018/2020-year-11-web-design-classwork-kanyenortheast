          <h3>Tower Bridge, London </h3>
          <p>This iconic old bridge is located right next to the Tower of London. We climbed across the top and
            were directly above the bridge when it opened up to allow boats through on the Queen's jubilee. </p>

          <h3>Stonehenge </h3>
          <p>This ancient stone circle stands alone on the wide Salisbury plains. It was below freezing on the day we visited! </p>
