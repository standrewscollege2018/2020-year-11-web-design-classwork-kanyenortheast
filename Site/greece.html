          <h3>Athens</h3>
          <p>The Parthenon is one of the most famous sights around the world.
             Despite having seen it thousands of times in pictures,
             it still stuns when you first see it in person.</p>

          <h3>Agia Triada</h3>
          <p>There are many monasteries on Crete, and none more beautiful and
            peaceful than Agia Triada. There were lovely gardens throughout,
            and it was quiet and calm, with few tourists around.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Zeus</h3>
          <p>The Temple of Olympian Zeus towers above you, yet is still
            dwarved by the Parthenon sitting atop the Acropolis in the
            backgrounds</p>
